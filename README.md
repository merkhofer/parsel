Parsel
======

Parsel is a very simple NLTK demo using Flask. A user can select which NLTK preprocessing techniques to run on an input string. Currently, sentence tokenizers, word tokenizers, "bag of words" and POS tagging are included (though not all fully implemented).

It is primarily being built a training ground for me on Flask/Jinja.

TODO:
Take a URL (use Beautiful Soup)
Add more NLTK functionality.
